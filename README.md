# gOut

This a small effects functions that will make a page look like it glitching out.

Just add gOut.js and gOut.css to your page and run gOut.start().

The effects are random and stackable. Add more to the CSS and change the gOut.fx value.

Tweak gOut.duration and gOut.interval to intensify or increase the number of glitched out elements.

Use this to have fun!
